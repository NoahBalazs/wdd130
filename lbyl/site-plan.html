        What is 3D Printing
      </p>
<p>3D Printing is a fun hobby!
3D printing makes digital objects come to life in a three-dimensional form.
There are two different kinds of printers, FDM and SLA. 
An SLA printer is a resin-based printing system.
An FDM is a filament-based printing system. FDM is more beginner-friendly and requires less work for the prints to be finished. This website will focus on FDM printing.
The way FDM printing works is by adding layer upon layer of heated plastic (filament) to the printing bed. The way it prints with filament is by heating up the filament and printing this heated filament on other layers of heated filament to bond the two layers.</p>

<p>Filaments
There are many different kinds of filaments, PLA, ABS, and PETG to name just a few. The most common kind of filament is PLA.
PLA is a compound plastic that has been made for its ease of use and how safe it is for hobbyists. 
ABS needs an enclosure as it produces harmful chemicals when heated up, but is stronger than PLA.
There are many types of filament options.  There are different materials and different colors.  Make sure to check what type of filament your 3D printer machine recommends.  Many machines will only work with a specific type of filament.
</p>

<p>
Be Patient
3D Printing can take a long time, especially with a more beginner-friendly printer. The 3D printing hobby is an awesome casual hobby because larger prints can take hours or even days. As you hone your skills and fine tune your machine, you can learn how to speed up the process.

      <h3>Tuning</h3>
      <p>
        Leveling the bed</p>
        <p>Not all printers require manually leveling the bed, but a lot of beginner friendly printers have beds that require you to manually level the bed.
Leveling the bed is easy. You will need a piece of paper. Make sure the hot end of the printing nozzle is cooled down, then put the piece of paper on the bed and lower the nozzle. Move the piece of paper back and forth and turn the leveling dial to raise or lower the bed. You are aiming for just a little bit of friction, which is the sweet spot. Move the nozzle to another corner of the bed and repeat the same process continue doing this until you donâ€™t need to adjust the dials anymore. Your bed is now level.
             </p>
             <p>Slicer options</p>
              <p>Your slicer is something you have to learn. Every printer is a bit different in size and speed that they can print at. Most printers have presets you can choose from that greatly decrease the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning the slicer setting beyond the preset is a good idea and something you will have to do to get the best print from your printer. YouTube is awesome for finding out how to properly fine tune your slicer settings.
             </p>
             <p>
              Benchmark prints</p>
              <p>Benchmark prints are an important part of fine-tuning your printer. You can learn about the Benchy benchmark print HERE.
             </p>
             <p></p>
              <p>Your choice of filament might be causing your problems. Different filaments need to be heated to different temperatures and be printed at different speeds. A lot of slicers have addons for temperature towers that can help you figure out the best temperature to print your filament at.

      <h3>Benchy</h3>
      <p>
        The Benchy
        The Benchy is a benchmark test, meant to see if your printer is set up correctly. It uses almost every kind of print you might be using, which will pinpoint any problems with accuracy and calibration.
         The Benchy is going to print a boat.  In this boat, there are a lot of hard-to-print features, such as an arch, cylinders, overhangs, tiny details, smooth surfaces, and horizontal holes.  It is also a great print for beginners to find out how to fine-tune their printer to achieve better prints, nicer-looking prints, and stronger prints. You should print the benchy and see if your printer is as finetuned as you think it is.
