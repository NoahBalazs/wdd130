                <h2>The Benchy</h2>
                <p>
                    The Benchy is a benchmark test, meant to see if your printer is set up correctly. It uses almost every kind of print you might be using, which will pinpoint any problems with accuracy and calibration. The Benchy is going to print a boat.  In this boat, there are a lot of hard-to-print features, such as an arch, cylinders, overhangs, tiny details, smooth surfaces, and horizontal holes.  It is also a great print for beginners to find out how to fine-tune their printer to achieve better prints, nicer-looking prints, and stronger prints. You should print the benchy and see if your printer is as finetuned as you think it is.
