                    <h2>What is 3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>
                        3D Printing is a fun hobby! 3D printing makes digital objects come to life in a three-dimensional form. There are two different kinds of printers, FDM and SLA.  An SLA printer is a resin-based printing system. An FDM is a filament-based printing system. FDM is more beginner-friendly and requires less work for the prints to be finished. This website will focus on FDM printing. The way FDM printing works is by adding layer upon layer of heated plastic (filament) to the printing bed. The way it prints with filament is by heating up the filament and printing this heated filament on other layers of heated filament to bond the two layers.

                    <h2>Filaments</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many different kinds of filaments, PLA, ABS, and PETG to name just a few. The most common kind of filament is PLA. PLA is a compound plastic that has been made for its ease of use and how safe it is for hobbyists. ABS needs an enclosure as it produces harmful chemicals when heated up, but is stronger than PLA. There are many types of filament options.  There are different materials and different colors.  Make sure to check what type of filament your 3D printer machine recommends.  Many machines will only work with a specific type of filament.

                        3D Printing can take a long time, especially with a more beginner-friendly printer. The 3D printing hobby is an awesome casual hobby because larger prints can take hours or even days. As you hone your skills and fine tune your machine, you can learn how to speed up the process.
