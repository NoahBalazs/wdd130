    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to introduce our customers to who we are and what we do.  They may be looking for information, have questions, or want to see what our services include. This site will accomplish this by showing our services and packages and sharing testimonials. A big function of the website will be to sell our product, which is white water river rafting.  Another function of the website is to answer questions that customers might have. This is a great place to start our customer service experience.  We can have a FAQ page, answering questions that many customers will have.  If they still have more questions, they can contact us through the website, or call us on the phone.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>There are two different audiences that I would aim for. The first group would be the adventurous people who are looking for a thrill, this group would be looking for huge rapids. They are there for the adventure and thrill of it all. The second group would be families that would like a single day or multi-day adventure. This second group is looking for more of a good weekend activity.  They would like to have an experience with little preparation and work on their part.  
      The family target group would be looking to have an activity that allows the family to spend time together and connect during a bonding experience.  They will want the experience to be safe, yet have an element of thrill seeking to it.  Catered meals, camping overnight, and small hikes. These are the type of activities that would be sought after for this group. The adventurous thrill seeking group will be wanting to play hard and find the next big thrill.  Most customers will access the website from a laptop and mobile phone.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
