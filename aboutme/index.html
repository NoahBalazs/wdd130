    <h2>Noah Balazs</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Noah. I just graduated from highschool this year. I like games, music, drawing, and puzzles. I am going for a software engineering degree.</p>
    <p>I have always been fasinated with coding, and learning how to code. I have taken some coding classes in high school and wish to learn more. I can't wait to start this class and learn everything I can from it. I have always been a member of the church and enjoy going to church as often as I can.</p>
